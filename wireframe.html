        <br>I’m a full-stack developer and tech enthusiast, who yet 
        prefers minimal specs on my laptops and smartphones 
        (Because software matters more!!).</h1>

        <h2>
            <p>I am an aspiring web developer and a current student at the online full-stack web development boot camp at Bloc. As a former electrical engineering student at the University of 
            Hawaii at Manoa, software development was my all-time favorite subject in the field of engineering. So much so that I made the decision to depart from academic life to start my
             career as a software developer despite having excellent academic records. 
            </p>
            <p>I LOVE coding because it makes my visualizations come to life and the satisfaction I get when solving problems that come along with it. In my leisure time, I find myself 
                checking tech news and tech Youtubers, staying up to date with new laptops, smartphones, and electric cars. I pride myself in taking part in the evolving world of new technologies.
